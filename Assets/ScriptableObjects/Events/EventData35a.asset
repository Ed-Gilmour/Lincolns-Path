  eventDescription: Mr. President, the Union has suffered a loss in the Battle of
    Chickamauga. General William Rosecrans reportedly falsely believed that a gap

    gap. General George Thomas then assumed command of Union forces and held the
    line till he withdrew at night.

    of Union forces in Tennessee.
